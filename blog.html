                        <h4>Percent(%)</h4> <br>
                        <p>	Sets the font-size to a percent of  the parent element's font size.
                            The value that the percentage 
                            is relative to can be either a 
                            value from the element’s parent or from 
                            another property of the element itself.  
                            percentage values don’t cascade as percentages, 
                            only calculated (computed) 
                            values are inherited.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box-2">
                        <h4>REM</h4>
                        <p>
                            rem values are 
                            relative to the root html element, 
                            not to the parent element. 
                            That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px 
                            then 1 rem = 16px for all elements. 
                            If font-size is not explicitly defined in root 
                            element then 1rem will be equal to the default font-size 
                            provided by the browser (usually 16px).
                        </p>

                    <div class="box-3">
                        <h4>EM</h4>
                        <p>
                            em is relative to the font-size of its 
                            direct or nearest parent. <br>
                            It inherits 
                            and scales relative to his parent.
                            <br>When em units are declared on child 
                            elements that don’t have a font-size defined, 
                            they will inherit their font-size from their parent, 
                            or from another ancestor element, possibly going all 
                            the way back to the root element on the document.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="box-4">
                    <div>
                        <p>Yes it does matter to use. Althougn There is 
                            similarity between this font style em and percent element, there is 
                            bit difference. EM works according to the font-size of the browser
                            , percent work according to the font-size of the its conainer, so
                            using both could be the same. On the other hand REM works on according to
                            the size of the html file(window), this could be helpful but is could lose some
                            attraction because all tags have to be assigned according to the root.

            <p class="title">Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 
                </p>
            <article>
                <div class="boxs">
                    <div class="box-31">
                        <h4>CSS3 Updates from previous Version</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>1. CSS 3 Selectors</p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the selectors that were available 
                            in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. 
                            Using these selectors you can choose DOM elements 
                            based on their attributes. So you don't need to 
                            specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, 
                            you can 
                            utilize the attribute field to style them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. CSS 3 Rounded Corners <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing 
                            the border-radius property, which gives you the 
                            same rounded-corner effect and you don't have to 
                            write all the code. Here are examples for displaying 
                            rounded corners in different places of a website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. CSS 3 Border Image <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to 
                            display instead ofa plain solid-colored border.
                        </p>
                        
                    </div>
                    <div class="box-32">
                        <p>
                            4. CSS 3 Box Shadow <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. 
                            Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around 
                            the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be 
                            achieved by writing a single line of CSS code.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>5. CSS 3 Text Shadow</p>
                        <p>
                            The new text-shadow property allows you to 
                            add drop shadows to the text on a webpage.
                             Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either 
                             using an image or duplicating a text element and 
                             then positioning it. A similar property called 
                            box-shadow is also available in CSS 3.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>7. CSS 3 RGBA: Color, Now with Opacity</p>
                        <p>
                            The RGB property in CSS is used to set colors 
                            for different elements. CSS 3 introduces a 
                            modification and added opacity manipulation to
                             this property. RGB has been transformed to RGBA 
                             (Red Green Blue Alpha channels), which simplifies 
                            how you control the opacity of elements.
